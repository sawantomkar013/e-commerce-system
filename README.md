# Order and Notification Microservices

This project is a technical assignment that implements a core part of a microservices-based e-commerce system. It features an **OrderService** that manages order lifecycle, integrates with a **NotificationService**, publishes events to Kafka, and uses Redis for caching.

The application is built on **.NET 8+** and adheres to modern architectural principles such as Clean Architecture and CQRS, emphasizing code quality and testability.
